\section{Diffusion Models and Bayesian Model Comparison}
\label{section:diffusion}

Since the dawn of time, Humans have noticed that they looked like their siblings and parents and wondered why. People have always thought about the balance between nature and nurture as in the famous fairy tale ``The Ugly Duckling'' by Hans Christian Andersen from 1843. Two decades later, Gregor Mendel founded genetics as a modern, scientifical discipline with his studies on trait inheritance in pea plants \autocite{mendelgregorVersucheUberPflanzenhybriden1866}, although it was not until a century later that Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA \autocite{watsonMolecularStructureNucleic1953}.

Since then, the field of genetics has grown exponentially and has become a central part of modern biology today. While \autoref{section:ancientDNA} discusses the behaviour of ancient DNA, Paper IV focusses on how living cells work and, in particular, how they regulate the transcription of DNA in the cell nucleus. All cells share the same building blocks in the form of DNA, however, they do not express the same instructions (genes). One of the most fundamental challenges in biology is understanding the mechanism of how cells can express and silence specific regions of the genome.

Currently, different biological models try to explain the physical principles creating the heterogeneous environment in the cell nucleus of eukaryotic cells.
One of these is the polymer-bridging model (PBM) that models the micro compartments called the foci. The cell nucleus contains two different types of loci; the repair foci and the silencing foci. Paper IV studies the physical mechanism of the formation of the silencing foci.

\autoref{fig:diffusion-model} illustrates the parts of the cell nucleus relevant to the polymer-bridging model. Inside the nucleus, DNA fibers are curled up where some parts of the DNA locate inside the silencing foci. Inside the silencing foci, the PBM predicts binding and bridging sites that interact with the DNA fiber through the SIR proteins, which is up-regulated inside the the region of the foci \autocite{heltbergPhysicalObservablesDetermine2021}. The SIR proteins repress the underlying genes, and, due to the increased concentration inside the focus, the foci are termed silencing foci.

        Illustration of the cell nucleus. The nucleus membrane is shown in red and the repair foci in yellow. The black line represents the DNA fiber which is curled up in the silencing foci in green. The right side of the figure shows a zoomin in view of the silencing foci according to the polymer-bridging model with the binding and bridging sites that interact with the SIR proteins. The tracking of the SIR molecules is shown as blue stars.

With the use of single particle tracking and photoactivated localization microscopy, it is possible to track the individual SIR molecules at high temporal and spatial resolution \autocite{oswaldImagingQuantificationTransmembrane2014,manleyHighdensityMappingSinglemolecule2008}. As the SIR molecules are assumed to follow a diffusion process, the tracking allows for the determination of the diffusion coefficients of cell nucleus, which help quantify the heterogeneous structure in the nucleus.

Assuming classical Brownian motion in 2D, the displacement lengths, $\Delta r_i$, defined as the distances between subsequent observations $\vec{x}$:
\begin{align}
    \Delta r_i = || \vec{x}_{i+1} - \vec{x}_{i} ||,
\end{align}
follows a Rayleigh distribution:
\begin{align}
    \mathrm{Rayleigh}(r; \sigma) =\frac{r}{\sigma^2} e^{-r^2/(2\sigma^2)} \quad r>0,
\end{align}
with scale parameter $\sigma = \sqrt{2d\tau}$, where $d$ is the diffusion coefficient and $\tau$ is the time between observations \autocite{bakerInferenceDiffusionCoefficients2021,andersonTrackingCellSurface1992}
.

Here $d_1$ is the diffusion coefficient, $\mathcal{R}_1$ is the $d$-parameterized Rayleigh distribution and $\mathcal{R}_{1,2}$ is the mixture model of the Rayleigh distributions with a $\theta$ prior.
